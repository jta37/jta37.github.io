		<h3>I'd Like to Introduce Myself</h3>
		<p>I was born and raised in a suburban town 15 minutes north of Pittsburgh. I grew up playing sports, bleeding Black & Gold and, and surrounded by technology.  I can still remember playing my dad's original Nintendo and experimenting with our Gateway computer almost 20 years ago.</p>
		<p>In the Summer of 2013, I became enamored with the startup world, entrepreneurial opportunity, and innovation in general. My friend recommended I read "The Lean Startup" by Eric Reis, and it was one of the better decisions I've ever made.  I was extremely passionate about the process, and started looking at problems in a new light. Taking a scientific approach to business in order to validate assumptions is a valuable tool. In short, this led me to Ruby on Rails, and eventually to GA.</p>

		<h3>Self-Teaching Programming & Web Development</h3>
		<p>I started building "slightly dynamic"(or "mostly static") websites using the Rails framework as a guide. I learned a ton, but was freelancing nearly the entire time. I used Twitter Bootstrap in almost all of my projects, and so my learning progressed furthest on the front-end of things.  HTML5 & CSS3 are largely similar, but Bootstrap has a number of advantages over vanilla HTML.</p>
